Anyone can write an ID
Tony Li noted the missing reference to
RFC4271
From -14 to -15

that I cannot type.
Feather pointed out (off-list)
Because I suspect that he's no longer watching
the draft, I made
the passive-aggressive snarking at Nick (see
-11
to -12 changes)
slightly less passive and slightly more
aggressive.
Some of this
is driven by the fact that COVID makes it
unlikely that I'll
see

From -13 to -14
John Scudder discovered nits.
From -12 to -13
Havard Eidnes pointed out that my grammar is
bad.
From -11 to -12
Nick Hilliard threated to block progress
unless we agreed to
include his section on cats.
While we don't
agree with his text/
section, we are sufficiently past caring about
this entire topic,
and so we are just including it, along with
a
passive aggressive
change-log note.
From
-10 to
-11
